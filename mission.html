              <p class="lead mb-4">
                Barrhaven Bible Chapel carries a burden to preach about God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit and to share God's love and His restoration plan for those who earnestly seeking God but have not yet found Him and to teach the whole council of God to those who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal saviour and Lord.

              <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Trinity â€“ God the Creator, Christ the Redeemer, and Holy Spirit the Helper</h3>
              
              <p class="mb-4">
                God the Father is the creator of all universes, visible and invisible. Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born as the son of man to be a Mediator between God and man. Through His vicarious sacrifice, He became a Redeemer of fallen man and creation. God the Holy Spirit works in the spirit of a sinner to bring conviction in conscience about sins. After conviction, when a sinner confesses his sins, repents, believes in Jesus Christ, and shows obedience to the voice of Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit works in this person and beautifies his inner being by renewing his spirit and soul so that he may become a compatible place for God to live in him now and he may be ready to be with God forever.

              <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Man (Soul) Seeking God (Spirit)</h3>
              
              <p class="mb-4">
                God is a Spirit (John 4:24) and man is a soul (He became a living soul Gen 2:7). A mediator between God and man is necessary because the Spirit and the Soul are distinct. Jesus Christ is that mediator because he is Son of God and son of man (Romans 1:3,4). Jesus was in the presence of God, and he had seen the things of heaven, "Verily verily I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and bear witness of that we have seen; and you receive not our witness" (John 3:11). God the Father also bears witness about Jesus Christ "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son. And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, which is in His Son" (1 John 5:9,11). He is the only mediator in whom salvation is promised, and eternal life is given as a gift to all who believe in Him. God himself bears witness to this truth. "For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times" (1 Tim 2:5,6).
              </p>

              <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Redemption of Mankind and the Gift of Eternal Life</h3>
              
              <p class="mb-4">
                God created man in His image (spirit) and after His likeness (moral behavior)." And God said let us make man in our image, after our likeness" (Gen 1:26). When man chose to eat the forbidden fruit, he disobeyed God and as a result, lost his likeness and his image was marred. However, God's love for us is unwavering, and He proved that by sending His only begotten son as a human being (son of man). This act of sending His son marked the beginning of the redemption process. He sent His son Jesus Christ to be the propitiation for the sins of all. "And He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our sins only, but also for the whole world" (1 John 2:2). Jesus Christ died on behalf of all people so that anyone who believes in him can be saved from eternal damnation. God promises the gift of eternal life to all those who believe. "For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day and defeated the power of death because He knew no sin (1 Peter 2:22). Now those who believe and identify in his death and resurrection on daily basis death will have no power on them. Lord Jesus's triumph over death justifies those freely from their sins before the Holy Father, who believe in Him. "Who (Jesus) was delivered for our trespasses and was raised for our justification" (Rom 4:25). This brings new life to all those who believe. "We were that like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. Wherefore if the man is in Christ, he is a new creature:" (Rom 6:4, 2Cor 5:17). This new life leads us towards the path of righteousness, where we are enabled to do what is right in the sight of God by the power of the Holy Spirit. By living this way, we reflect God's nature and character, which is the opposite of the behavior seen in this world. All of this is a result of the amazing grace that God has shown towards man.

              <h3 class="h4 mb-3">God's Purpose in Creating Man and His Saving Grace</h3>
              
              <p class="mb-4">
                Barrhaven Bible Chapel carries a burden to enlighten people about God's purpose for creating humans and how it is fulfilled by sending His only begotten Son Jesus Christ and through the work of the Holy Spirit in guiding and shaping their lives for heavenly glory.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                God created man with a definite purpose. "And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (Gen 1:26). Man, disobeyed God and sinned. Sin came in and disrupted the entire purpose of God. Due to sin, man lost the likeness of God and marred the image in which man was created, hindering his intended dominion over the creation. He could not understand or receive God's light to execute God's administration on earth. He lost the privilege of being a representative of Heavenly Father and God.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                God's divine purposes could not be thwarted. Jesus Christ served as humanity's representative and fulfilled God's Will while living on earth. Thus, Jesus Christ was exalted by God to be the ruler of both heaven and earth, a role that will soon be fulfilled. Meanwhile, those who believed in Jesus Christ will be enabled by the power of the Holy Spirit to defeat the power of sin. Holy Spirit works in them to bring back the image which was marred. He will also work in them to form the likeness which is a moral character required to have dominion over the creation. When the work of forming image and likeness is completed in believers, Jesus Christ will return and establish His kingdom upon earth. Thus, the good pleasure of God's will and purpose will be realized for man and in man. This is God's immense grace through the Holy Spirit to restore humanity to its desired state and dominion. All honor and glory be given to God.

              <h3 class="h4 mb-3">Seeking God and Desiring Holiness?</h3>
              
              <p class="mb-4">
                Do you know who God is? Do you know that God loves you? No matter what state or situation you are in, God invites you to come to Him. Experience His love and receive the gift of eternal life, which is the very life of God.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                Jesus Christ is interested in your life and wants to save you for eternity. He died for your sins so that you would not stand condemned before God's judgment seat. Come to Him, believe in Him, and His work on the cross. Your sins will be forgiven, and you will be given a new nature to have fellowship with God.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                Do you desire to live an overcoming life over the nature and power of sin? Do you want to be with Jesus Christ as a ruler in the coming dispensation? The Holy Spirit is interested in working in you and preparing you for the glories ahead in heaven and earth.
